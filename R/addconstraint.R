#' @title Adds constraints to the model.
#'
#' @description The specified constraints are added to the model.
#' If parameter \code{ct} is a vector, it is expected to be a set of transition
#' probabilities indexed as in field transitions of the model. In this
#' case the constraint added is the equality between the referred probabilities of
#' transition.
#' If parameter \code{ct} is a matrix, it is expected to be a system of additional
#' linear equalities that the model must fulfill. Thus, the new equations
#' are added to the field constraints of the model.
#' While it is possible to use a matrix to add equality constraints, it is not
#' recommended because of performance.
#' Previous constraints of the model are preserved.
#'
#' @param x A HMM object.
#' @param ct The additional constraints, which can be either a
#' matrix or a vector (see details).
#'
#' @return A HMM object similar to the input but with the additional
#' constraints.
