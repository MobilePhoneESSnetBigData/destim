#' @title Sets the initial state to the steady state
#'
#' @description The initial a priori distribution is set to the steady state of
#' the transition matrix.
#'
#' The Markov Chain is expected to be irreducible and aperiodic. The
#' first because otherwise the devices would not have freedom of
#' movement. The second because some probabilities from one state
#' to itself are expected to be non zero. This implies that there
#' exists one unique steady state.
#'
#' The steady state is computed by solving the sparse linear system (TM - I)x = 0,
#' where TM is the matrix of transitions I is identity and x the steady state.
#' As it is an homogeneous system, and because of the uniqueness of the steady
#' state, the solution is a one dimensional vector space, and the generator does
#' not have any coordinate equal to zero. Then the last coordinate is set to
#' 1 / number of states, so the sparse linear system becomes inhomogeneous with
#' unique solution. Finally the solution is normalized so that the components of
#' x sum up to 1.
#'
#' @param x A HMM object.
#'
#' @return The same HMM object of the input with its initial state set
#' to steady state.
