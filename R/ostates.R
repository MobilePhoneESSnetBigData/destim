#'@title This function returns the observed states whenever an
#' observation is present.

#' @param P Transition matrix P(will go to i | is in j)
#' @param E Event observation matrix P(detection event j | is in i)
#' @param e Sequence of observation events. Since we are taking
#' time increase small, it is expected to have mostly missing
#' values. The first value is expected to have an observation.
#' @return the observed states whenever an observation is present.
